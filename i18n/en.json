        "paragraph2": "We keep to three core points: the atmosphere at the entrance, the seating layout in the lounge, and how light shifts on the way to the meeting room. Together they answer the first questions about the lobby and set the stage for the rest of the session."

        "paragraph2": "The material palette reinforces the emotion we want the light to convey. Matte surfaces soften it, while brass or copper details sharpen the focal points. Limiting the palette to three main tones keeps the story clear."
